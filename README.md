# Task-6-Create-a-Strong-Password
Understand what makes a password strong.

I created multiple passwords with different levels of complexity, tested them using password strength checkers, and documented the results and best practices.

Passwords Created and comprasion.

| Password                | Complexity Level | Length | Components Used                     |
|------------------------ |------------------|--------|-------------------------------------|
| Mango23                 | Low              | 7      | Uppercase, lowercase, numbers       |
| Vamsi@123               | Medium           | 9      | Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols |
| #R3dSun$et              | High             | 10     | Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols |

Password Best Practices
Make it long – Aim for at least 12 characters. More is better.

Mix it up – Use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Stay unpredictable – Avoid common words, phrases, or anything tied to your personal life (like birthdays or pet names).

Think in phrases – Strong passphrases are easier to remember and harder to crack.

Store smartly – Use a password manager to keep track of complex passwords securely.

Double up on security – Turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible.


Common Password Attacks

1. Brute Force Attack:

This method tries every possible combination until it cracks the password.
How to protect yourself: Use long, complex passwords that make guessing impractical.

2. Dictionary Attack:

Relies on a list of common words and predictable combinations.
How to protect yourself: Avoid real words and add randomness with symbols, numbers, and unexpected patterns.

Conclusion:

This task deepened my understanding of how to create strong passwords, recognize weak ones, and use tools to assess their security. I’ve come to appreciate the critical role password strength and multi-factor authentication (MFA) play in keeping accounts secure.
